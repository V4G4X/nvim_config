# My personal Nvim config

Tried out some nvim distributions and they were a headache considering
I didn't know nvim, lua and the works.

Hence, this is the config I build from scratch.

The point of this README is to tell you're better off building
your own nvim config, instead of using this.
Or just go back to VS Code, Occam's Razer is real.

## Clone
